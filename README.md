# Context

One of my goals here is to create the **easiest** and **quickest** demo available around the Docker ecosystem. I really wished I had this when I started (while back docker-compose was called fig). Please enjoy this gift.

I hope the community will use this repo as a base project to demo other stuff like CMS, Log, Monitoring, Volume and Storage, Dbs, Benchmark tools and other cool applications we love to use in Docker.

To accomplish this, we put together the power of:

- play-with-docker (#pwg)
- Docker Swarm mode
- Docker stacks

**Quick links**
  
- [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
- [Licence](./LICENCE.md)
- [Conduct of Code](./Code-of-Conduct.md)

### Start here
This is a monorepo or an aggregation of mini-projects if you prefer. Just navigate the directories! The most solid stack at the moment is: `traefik_stack1`.
